        <p>This week we met as a team Wednesday morning. We pushed our work to the master and made sure all the tests passed.
        We realized that we had two user stories left. Charlie and Alex selected these stories from the kanban board and assigned
        to themselves for completion. Elyse was assigned the Scrum report due on Monday. We have 
        completed the first phase of the project at this point. </p>
        <p>On Friday, Dec 13th, we received notification from our shareholder that they want us to complete some A/B 
        During our next scrum meeting we are going to determine what tasks completing the testing will entail, assign them points
        and add to the kanban board. Additionally we will also discuss making the site more aesthetically
        pleasing and assigning new user stories to that effect at our next meeting. </p>
        <p> Our first group sprint we developed the input form for events. Our second meeting we attempted to write the
        validation code for that form, but were unable to complete it. We anticipate completing that and the other two 
        in progress user stories before the next report. Our third group sprint assigned team members individual work
        once everyone was feeling more comfortable with the process.</p>
        <p>User Stories In Progress</p>
        <ol>
         <li>None</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Product Backlog</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A/B Testing (too be divided into tasks at next scrum meeting)</li
        </ol>
        <p>Note on story estimating: We assigned values to our user stories by averaging the estimated difficulty assigned by each member of the team on the Fibonacci sequence scale. We then rounded to the closest number on the scale. </p>
