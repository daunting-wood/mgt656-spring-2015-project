        </ol>
        <p>This week we met as a team Wednesday morning. We pushed our work to the master, and made sure all the tests passed.
        We realized that we had 2 user stories left. We assigned these two tasks to Charlie and Alex for completion, and assigned
        Elyse the Scrum report due on Monday. Therefore, we expect to have completed the first phase of the project by Monday November 16. 
        </p>Our new user stories will be generated by our shareholders and we eagerly await them! We will also discuss making the site more asthetically 
        pleasing and assigning new user stories to that effect at our next meeting. </p>
        <p> Our first group sprint we developed the input form for events. Our second meeting we attempted to write the
        validation code for that form, but were unable to complete it. We anticipate completing that and the other two 
        in progress user stories before the next report. Our third group sprint assigned team members individual work
        once everyone was feeling more comfortable with the process.</p>
        <p>User Stories In Progress</p>
        <ol>
         <li>None</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Product Backlog</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Scrum 5</li> 
        </ol>
        <p>Note on story estimating: We assigned values to our user stories by averaging the estimated difficulty assigned by each member of the team on the Fibonacci sequence scale. We then rounded to the closest number on the scale. </p>
