        <p>###CHANGEThis past week we met as a team to review where we stood. We determined that we had completed all of the user stories and passed all tests
        that had been assigned to us for the project thus far, so we patted ourselves on the back and then created a new user story
        to set up A/B testing for the RSVP link given the new assignment that we had just received from Kyle. After that we created
        9 new user stories related to formatting our website to make it look purty, which are listed below:###
        We also added one more story. We split A/B testing into two seperate tasks and added A/B testing for Donation link,
        worth 5 points.

        <p>Note on story estimating: We assigned values to our user stories by averaging the estimated difficulty assigned by each member of the team on the Fibonacci sequence scale. We then rounded to the closest number on the scale. </p>
